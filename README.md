# ðŸŽ§ HitSense: Predicting Hit Potential of Songs

## Author

Capstone project for Data Science Certification, 2025

## Overview
**HitSense** is a machine learning project designed to estimate the **hit potential** of songs based on their audio features. By using Spotify audio features like danceability, energy, tempo, and valence, I trained a regression model to predict a trackâ€™s likelihood of being a hit, expressed as a **percentage score**.

This is part of a capstone assignment for a data science program, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development.

## Dataset
Using a simplified version of the [Spotify Audio Features Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks). A sample subset is included here for demonstration purposes.

**Files:**
- `data/hitsense_raw.csv` â€” raw input data
- `data/hitsense_cleaned.csv` â€” feature-engineered dataset used for modeling

---

## EDA and Feature Engineering
- Missing values: None in this sample
- New features:
  - `hit_score`: normalized popularity (`popularity / 100`)
  - `vibe_score`: interaction of danceability and valence
- Correlation analysis showed strong relationships between energy, danceability, and popularity

---

## Model
We used a simple **Linear Regression** model to serve as a baseline.

### Features used:
- Danceability
- Energy
- Tempo
- Valence
- Acousticness
- Vibe Score

### Performance:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): _low on small sample_
- RÂ² Score: _contextually strong for linear baseline_

Future improvements could include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or even neural networks using larger data.
